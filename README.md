Hello. This is my program based on the Doomsday Algorithm, a mental math trick used to calculate the day of the week for any given day, month, and year.

How to play

The way this works is by remembering a few specific days, which we call "anchor days" or "doomsdays". These are days that, for any given year, will always fall on the same day of the week as each other- ie. if, for a given year, June 6th lies on a Wednesday, August 8th will lie on a Wednesday as well. In this case, Doomsday is Wednesday.
<br>Do some simple arithmetic to find out what Doomsday is for any year, and count backwards or forwards from the closest Doomsday, and there you have the day of the week for any date*!
<br>*on the Gregorian calendar.

| Months  | Anchor | Mnemonic device* |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| January  | 3 (4 on leap years)  | leap day is every FOUR years |
| February  | 28 (29 on leap years)  | last day of february |
| March  | 14  | pi day 3.14 |
| April  | 4  | 4/4 |
| May  | 9  | i work 9-5 at the 7/11 |
| June  | 6  | 6/6 |
| July  | 11  | i work 9-5 at the 7/11 |
| August  | 8  | 8/8 |
| September  | 5  | i work 9-5 at the 7/11 |
| October  | 10  | 10/10 |
| November  | 7  | i work 9-5 at the 7/11 |
| December  | 12  | 12/12 |

<br>*note 4 months are covered by "i work 9-5 at the 7/11"; all even months except february are covered by 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, & 12/12; february is simple to remember as the last day of the month & march is pi day (a nerd number, and this game is only for nerds). the only month without a very easy to remember doomsday is january, however "3 out of 4 years, doomsday is the 3rd, on the 4th year (leap year), doomsday is the 4th" is good enough in my opinion.

<br> another note: [this website](https://rudy.ca/doomsday.html) has very complete & clear instructions and is highly recommended for a better overview of the doomsday algorithm!

rest of instructions are under construction. next I will be explaining to you how to calculate the doomsday for any year.
